# Blockchain Glossary

### 1. Blockchain  
Imagine a digital notebook that everyone can see but no one can change. This notebook is shared across many computers worldwide, and it keeps a record of all the important things, like transactions. Once something is written in the notebook, it stays there forever, so everyone knows it's trustworthy.

### 2. Cryptocurrency  
Think of it like digital money that lives on the internet. It’s not printed like paper money, and no one controls it, not even a bank. People use it to buy things, trade, or save it for later. The most famous one is Bitcoin!

### 3. Wallet  
A digital wallet is like your piggy bank, but for cryptocurrencies. It’s a special app or device that keeps your crypto safe. Only you have the key (a secret code) to open it and use your money.

### 4. Smart Contract  
This is like a robot lawyer that follows rules. It’s a computer program that does things automatically when conditions are met. For example, if you send money to buy something, the smart contract ensures you get what you paid for without needing a middleman.

### 5. NFT (Non-Fungible Token)  
An NFT is like a one-of-a-kind digital sticker or collectible. Each one is special and can’t be copied. People use NFTs to own and trade unique things like art, music, or even video clips on the internet.
