# Blockchain Glossary

### 1. Blockchain  
Imagine a digital notebook that everyone can see but no one can change. This notebook is shared across many computers worldwide, and it keeps a record of all the important things, like transactions. Once something is written in the notebook, it stays there forever, so everyone knows it's trustworthy.

### 2. Cryptocurrency  
Think of it like digital money that lives on the internet. It’s not printed like paper money, and no one controls it, not even a bank. People use it to buy things, trade, or save it for later. The most famous one is Bitcoin!

---

### 3. Wallet  
A digital wallet is like your piggy bank, but for cryptocurrencies. It’s a special app or device that keeps your crypto safe. Only you have the key (a secret code) to open it and use your money.

---

### 4. Smart Contract  
This is like a robot lawyer that follows rules. It’s a computer program that does things automatically when conditions are met. For example, if you send money to buy something, the smart contract ensures you get what you paid for without needing a middleman.

### 5. NFT (Non-Fungible Token)  
An NFT is like a one-of-a-kind digital sticker or collectible. Each one is special and can’t be copied. People use NFTs to own and trade unique things like art, music, or even video clips on the internet.

---

### 6. Decentralization  
This means there’s no single boss or owner. Instead, everyone has a say. In blockchain, this happens because the data is shared across many computers instead of being controlled by one person or company.

---

### 7. Gas Fees
Imagine you’re sending a package by mail—you need to pay for delivery. In the world of blockchain, gas fees are like postage. They’re small payments you make to help computers process your transactions, especially on networks like Ethereum.

---

### 8. Token
A token is like a special coin used inside a digital game or online community. Some tokens represent money, while others can be used for voting or getting rewards in apps built on blockchains.

---

### 9. Mining
Mining is like a giant puzzle-solving game. Powerful computers compete to solve hard math problems. When they win, they get to add a new page to the blockchain notebook and earn crypto as a reward—just like finding digital treasure!

---

### 10. DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization)
A DAO is like an online club with no single leader. Instead, members vote on decisions using tokens, and everything runs by code. It’s a way for people to work together fairly using blockchain rules.

---

### 11. Private Key
This is your secret password that unlocks your crypto wallet. It’s super important—if someone else gets it, they can take your money. So always keep it safe and never share it!

---

### 12. Public Key
Think of it like your email address, but for receiving crypto. You can share your public key with others so they can send you money, but only you (with your private key) can access it.
